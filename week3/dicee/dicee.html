  AI-GENERATED: DICEE GAME - HTML STRUCTURE
  ==========================================
  This HTML file creates the visual layout for a simple dice game where two players
  roll virtual dice to determine a winner. The page structure follows standard HTML5 conventions.
  
  AI-GENERATED EDUCATIONAL NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
  - Modify the title in the <title> tag to change the browser tab name
  - Add more <link> tags to import additional fonts or stylesheets
  - Change the game heading text in the <h1> tag
  - Add more player sections by duplicating the <div class="dice"> blocks
  - Modify image sources to point to different dice images
-->

<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <!-- 
    AI-GENERATED: HEAD SECTION EXPLANATION
    ======================================
    Contains metadata and configuration for the page.
    This section is NOT displayed on the page but provides important information to the browser

    <!-- 
      AI-GENERATED: CHARSET (Character Set)
      Specifies that this page uses UTF-8 encoding
      This allows the page to correctly display international characters and emojis
      Tip: Always include this as the first meta tag for security reasons
    -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    
    <!-- 
      AI-GENERATED: TITLE TAG
      Sets the text shown in the browser tab
      This also appears in search results and browser history
      Best Practice: Keep titles descriptive and under 60 characters
    -->
    <title>Dicee</title>
    
    <!-- 
      AI-GENERATED: LINK TO CSS
      Connects this HTML file to the stylesheet (styles.css)
      The stylesheet controls all visual styling: colors, fonts, layout, spacing, etc.
      Relationship: "stylesheet" means this CSS file styles this HTML document
      Why separate CSS and HTML? Keeps content (HTML) separate from presentation (CSS)

      AI-GENERATED: GOOGLE FONTS

      This example imports two fonts:
        1. Indie+Flower: A casual, handwriting-style font
        2. Lobster: A bold, decorative font for headings
      To use different fonts: Visit fonts.google.com, select fonts, and copy the link here

  <!-- 
    AI-GENERATED: BODY SECTION
    Contains all visible content that displays on the page
    Everything users see is inside the <body> tag
  -->
  <body>

    <!-- 
      AI-GENERATED: CONTAINER DIV
      A wrapper that groups all game content
      The class="container" connects this <div> to CSS styling in styles.css
      This container ensures the game content is centered and properly formatted
      
      AI-GENERATED EXPLANATION - HOW CLASSES WORK:
      - A CSS class is defined with a period (.) in the stylesheet: .container { ... }
      - In HTML, we apply that class using: class="container"
      - One class can be used on multiple elements throughout the page
    -->
    <div class="container">
      <!-- 
        AI-GENERATED (UX IMPROVEMENT): GAME TITLE

            AI-GENERATED: DICE IMAGE
            Displays a PNG image of a dice
            Attributes explained:
            
            class="img1": 
              - Connects to CSS styling for Player 1's image
              - Could be used in JavaScript to select and modify this specific image
              - Multiple classes can be added: class="img1 dice-image"
            
            src="images/dice6.png":
              - "src" = "source" (location of the image file)
              - "images/" = folder where dice images are stored
              - "dice6.png" = specific image file (dice showing 6)
              - Currently shows 6 on page load; JavaScript changes this to random numbers
              
            AI-GENERATED EXTENSION IDEAS:
            - Change src path if you move images to different folder
            - Add alt text for accessibility: alt="Dice showing current roll"
            - Add onclick event to roll dice on click instead of page refresh

        Identical structure to Player 1, but for the second player
        
        The <div class="dice"> styling applies to BOTH players automatically
        because they both use the same "dice" class
        
        class="img2":
        - Different from img1 to allow different styling or JavaScript manipulation
        - Example: You could make Player 2's image larger or different color

    <!-- 
      AI-GENERATED: SCRIPT TAG
      Links to external JavaScript file
      
      src="index.js": Points to the file containing the game logic
        - This file runs the code that generates random numbers
        - It selects random dice images
        - It determines and displays the winner
      
      charset="utf-8": Specifies character encoding for the JavaScript file
        - Ensures special characters and emojis are handled correctly
      
      AI-GENERATED EXPLANATION - WHY SEPARATE HTML AND JAVASCRIPT?
      - HTML = Structure and content (what's on the page)
      - JavaScript = Behavior and interactivity (what happens when you interact)
      - Keeping them separate makes code more organized and reusable
      
      AI-GENERATED EXECUTION ORDER:
      1. Browser reads and displays all HTML content first
      2. Then it executes the JavaScript code
      3. JavaScript modifies the HTML content (changes dice images)
      
      AI-GENERATED EXTENSION IDEAS:
      - Add more <script> tags to include additional JavaScript files
      - Add event listeners in JavaScript for click events on dice
      - Create functions to validate player input or keep score

        Remove </body> above, move footer inside body, then add closing </body> after footer
        
        AI-GENERATED EXTENSION IDEAS:
